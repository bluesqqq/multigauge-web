## About

`multigauge-web` is the WebAssembly/browser target for [`multigauge-core`](https://github.com/bluesqqq/multigauge-core).

This repo builds the Multigauge runtime for the web and outputs the generated browser artifacts into [`web/dist/`](./web/dist/).

## Quick Start

Get a web build running in a few minutes.

### 1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bluesqqq/multigauge-web.git
cd multigauge-web
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### 2. Install prerequisites

You will need:

- [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/)
- [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/)
- [Emscripten SDK (emsdk)](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html)

### 3. Make `emsdk` available

The build scripts look for `emsdk` in this order:

1. `EMSDK` environment variable
2. `./emsdk` inside this repo
3. `../emsdk` next to this repo

If your `emsdk` install lives somewhere else, set `EMSDK` first.

### 4. Build

#### Windows
```powershell
.\build.ps1
```

Release build:
```powershell
.\build.ps1 -Configuration Release
```

#### Linux
```bash
chmod +x ./build.sh
./build.sh
```

Release build:
```bash
./build.sh Release
```

### 5. Done

The generated artifacts will be written to [`web/dist/`](./web/dist/):

- [`web/dist/multigauge.js`](./web/dist/multigauge.js)
- [`web/dist/multigauge.wasm`](./web/dist/multigauge.wasm)
- [`web/dist/multigauge.wasm.map`](./web/dist/multigauge.wasm.map)

## Manual Build

If you prefer to build without the helper scripts, you can use the CMake presets directly:

```bash
cmake --preset wasm-debug
cmake --build --preset wasm-debug
```

Release:

```bash
cmake --preset wasm-release
cmake --build --preset wasm-release
```

## Project Layout

- [`web/src/`](./web/src/) contains the web target sources and Emscripten-specific platform bindings
- [`web/bindings/`](./web/bindings/) contains the JS/WASM bindings
- [`multigauge-core/`](./multigauge-core/) is the shared core renderer/editor library
- [`web/dist/`](./web/dist/) contains the generated browser build outputs and `mg.js`
- [`CMakeLists.txt`](./CMakeLists.txt) defines the wasm target and output paths
- [`CMakePresets.json`](./CMakePresets.json) defines the standard debug and release configure/build presets

## Notes

- The build output is intentionally written into [`web/dist/`](./web/dist/) rather than the CMake build directory.
- The helper scripts are convenience wrappers around the same preset-based CMake flow used for manual builds.
- This repo currently targets the browser/WebAssembly build. Native desktop or server targets would need separate platform wiring.

`multigauge-web` is actively under development.
